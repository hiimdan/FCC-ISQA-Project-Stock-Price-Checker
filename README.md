# FCC-ISQA-Project-Stock-Price-Checker
Free Code Camp Information &amp; Quality Assurance Project

Project Stock Price Checker

- SET NODE_ENV to test without quotes and set DB to your mongo connection string
- Complete the project in `routes/api.js` or by creating a handler/controller
- You will add any security features to `server.js`
- You will create all of the functional tests in `tests/2_functional-tests.js`

**Note:** In order for the FCC functional tests to be able to be repeatedly executed, an additional route, `routes/likeTesting.js`, was added which removes the ip as a result of the requests sent via the chai testing suite.
